Problem 1
Given a list nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, list length], write a function
that solves the following problem; return a list of all the integers in the range [1, list length]
that do not appear in nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]

Constraints:
•	n == nums.length
•	1 <= n <= 10^5
•	1 <= nums[i] <= n
